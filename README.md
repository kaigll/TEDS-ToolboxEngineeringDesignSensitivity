# Toolbox for Engineering Design Sensitivity (TEDS)

As the design requirements are evolving during the design process, we have divided the design process into two stages, the early conceptual design stage and the detailed design stage. At detailed stages of the design process, we normally have a specified design target or key performance indicator (KPI).

The need is to find the probability that the design will meet the target, P_f, and also the sensitivity of this probability to input data so that design decisions can be made accordingly. In this case, the design metrics are denoted as KPI-based and are most suitable for detailed design stages. 

On the other hand, at early design stages, a specific design requirement is not normally available. This could be due to either too much uncertainty to fix the requirements, or a preference to waive specific requirements so that a much wider design space can be explored. As there are no specific design KPIs, the design metrics that are most suitable at the conceptual design stage are called KPI-free metrics. The KPI-free metrics are the design entropy H and its sensitivity to perturbations of design parameters, which are independent of specific design targets (KPIs).
